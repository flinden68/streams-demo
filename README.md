# Streams Demo
Demo application for my presentation about Spring Cloud Streams and a NodJS. 
How to produce and consume messages from a Event Bus.
It uses RabbitMQ with Spring Cloud Streams and NodeJS and Redis and MongoDb as datastore.


## Event Bus
RabbitMQ and Kafka is one of the most used event bus. RabbitMQ can be easily installed locally or configured in the Cloud.

RabbbitMQ has a builtin management console, [see](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html)

## Datastore
I have used MongoDb and Redis as Datastore. 

### Mongodb
MongoDb can be installed locally.
For more infomation, [see](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community)
A very good GUI is [MongoDb Compass Community edition](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass)

### Redis
Redis can also be installed locally
For more information, [see](https://redis.io/topics/quickstart)
A nice GUI is [Redily](https://www.redily.app/)
